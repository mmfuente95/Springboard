# Welcome to Marcelo Fuentes' Github Repository
The "Personal Projects" folder has my personal portfolio of Machine Learning/Data Science Projects:
#1: Forecasting the S&P Returns using Machine Learning Models (Models Implemented: ARIMA, VAR, Ridge Regression and Recursive Neural Network)
#2: Predicting Music Popularity using Spotify's Data (Models Implemented: k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Ordinary Least Squares)  

The folder with "Springboard Coursework" has all the files I worked on during my Springboard Data Science Certification Training.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me via email (mm.fuenteslopez@gmail.com) or my direct line (315) 664-1111
